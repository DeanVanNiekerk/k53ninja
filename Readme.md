K53 Ninja will guide you through the process of preparing for your K53 learners license test.

Some of K53 Ninja features include:

-   The Study section: contains all the K53 study material and a tracker which logs the sections you have read through.
-   The Dojo section: practise by completing test questions, all your progress is tracked and indicated by Level.
-   The Arena section: test your skill by completing mock tests that are set up and marked in the same way as the real one.

K53 Ninja contains a bank of over 400 tough test questions. Test are dynamically generated so you will never feel like you are repeating tests.

We are very confident that if you attain Level 5 in the Dojo and complete the Arena at least 3 times that you will easily pass on the big day of the test.
